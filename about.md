## Hi, I'm Daniel

I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. After college, I decided to take advantage of one of the top mobile development courses at the Iron Yard in Atlanta. While there, I learned everything about creating native IOS apps in the Swift and Objective-C language. Shortly after completing the program, I began freelancing. 

After finding success following the Iron Yard, I began doing some freelance work, I elected to take a second intensive course on User Experience Design design a year later. Completing the User Experience Design program has complemented my expertise as a mobile developer and has also made me a much more skilled designer. Having the ability to understand both design and development makes me a unique asset to the technology world being able to bridge the gap between misunderstandings that designers and developers constantly have. 

By 2015, I wanted to find a more permanent job and was also interested in experiencing life in a different city. My decision was made easy when I visited Austin Texas and soon after I had moved down. After working in Austin for a few years I moved back to my home town in Atlanta. Since then I have continued in technology specializing in User Experience design. In 2023 and early 2024 I have received two certifications in Generative Artificial Intelligence and LLM’s.
Now that I have all of these abilities in a city with such a solid tech scene I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds! 

Since my journey in technology I have been freelancing, tech consulting, contract, and permanent positions. As of 2024 I have 9 year of expience in technology and the User Experience Field.
