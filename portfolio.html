                <p>Shelter Mobile is a mobile application prototype that I created with two other designers. The client gave us the details for our project and we had to have a prototype in InVision ready for her ready in four days. Our task was to make a platform for foster parents to arrange rides to and from adoption events and clinic visits for their respective foster pets. This project will showcase my ability to collaborate with other designers, produce Design Research/UX Research, Style Tiles, Sketches, Wireframes, Mockups(created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator) and InVision Prototypes.</p>

                <h1 class="project-title">Circuit</h1>
                <p>The idea behind Circuit was to create an app that allowed it’s users to interactively see where their friends were, see what was going on with their friends with a snapshot, and what cool places they had been visiting throughout the day. This project encompassed a wide range of UI and UX discoveries, planning, design, prototyping, and development. I helped create and build from the concept all the way to the fully developed app for IOS. This project will showcase my ability to do some UI/UX/Visual Design process involved in creating a mobile app from the start of a project to the end product.</p>

                <p>Pocket is a popular website with over 15 million users where you can easily save your favorite articles, videos and more for later. I coded a responsive version of Pocket from visually looking at a screenshot of the site. This project will showcase my ability to code a responsively designed website using mixin grids with SCSS(Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. Think CSS with superpowers).</p>

                <h1 class="project-title">Eagle Eye Networks</h1>
                <p>I was the Lead UI/UX Designer during my time at Eagle Eye. Eagle Eye Networks is a surveillance company on the cutting edge of cloud based video surveillance. While I was there some of the projects I worked on included:<br>
<br> 
Designing the Eagle Eye Installer mobile app to help assist installers from companies ranging from ADT/Protection One, Tyco, etc.; I was on the exclusive team to create Eagle Eye’s second product to date called the Transaction Recording System. My role in this was to figured out the right way to market it and to design the User Interface and prototype for the Web-App that should be rolled out in the near future; I redesigned Eagle Eye’s Wordpress website and did a full site walk -through recording all problems with functionality, User interface problems and UX problems the site had. Then went through the whole site and fixed these problems with my CSS and HTML expertise; I redesigned Eagle Eye’s surveillance Web-App by creating many Hi-fidelity mockups and iterations of those mockups to improve usability and intuitive interactions for their users; I created a heat map of the world and the locations around the world that Eagle Eye is currently in; I used Adobe InDesign to create Data Sheets for Eagle Eye’s products, designed Eagle Eye’s Catalog for it’s new line of products; I created the marketing campaign banners for the upcoming American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) EXPO; I also created many customized promotional ads targeting specific companies that we wanted to use our service.<br>
<br>
I had to sign a NDA for the work I did while at Eagle Eye, so it’s not something I can put on my portfolio publicly. However this work is available on my computer which I can show in person.
