title: "User Interface Design at The Iron Yard"

I have learned a lot in my first week and a half. I’ve already designed the first website for the course and just leaned how to code in SCSS which is an extension of CSS with the ability to do much more. I was sick a couple day’s, but even so I feel like I have a great handle on everything! I’m really enjoying the class and I can’t wait to start interviewing for jobs down here in Austin.
