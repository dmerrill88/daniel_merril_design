title:  "The Wonders of Illustrator"
---

I’ve been working with the whole Adobe Creative Suite for a few months now and it amazes me how much more I have learned to do in Adobe Illustrator in such a short time. Previously I had been using Adobe’s Photoshop to create everything from mockups to typographic discoveries to generating style tiles. Illustrator has given me the ability to do all sorts of things and previously I hadn’t thought these things could be done with such ease. Now I can even also create and customize things on a much more intricate level, whereas before I had to use the templates on programs like Balsamic and Sketch to do wireframes and things of that nature.

Illustrator doesn’t only make it easer to do things, but there’s so many different things that can be done. Thinking off the top of my head just some of the things that I have been able to do include: wireframes, pixel perfect mockups, logo’s, icon’s, style tiles, user flows, intricate use cases, menu prototypes, and everything in-between; I was even able to design my resume from scratch in Illustrator (I did’t feel like buying a template online) and it didn’t take all that much time. One more thing I wanted to add is how great Illustrator works with Typekit(another Adobe Creative Suite tools that focuses on typography) and how great it is to have the kind of typography I want.
